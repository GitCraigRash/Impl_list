normal distribution =  isotropic normal distribution with
diagonal covariance, xi ∼ N (0, σId) where Id is the d × d identity matrix and σ > 0.

Generate random 2 class data with normal distribution and very noisy features where N number of examples and d = number of features and y =r/n.
Set y < 1/2 
Use logistic regression to train a model for one or two epochs.
Test training and validation accuracy. 
Train for many additional epochs. 
Test training and validation accuracy.
