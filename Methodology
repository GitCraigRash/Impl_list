I am thinking about just reading the abstracks, setup and results, that way I don't get caught up reading about all the observations that may be irrelevant. 
Instead of reading the observations, 
1. I'll only read the abstracts and results,
2. think of a goal that uses mutiple papers,
3. Plan my step by step process.
4. plan what qualities my overhead will need.
5. Decide what materials will be best.
6. Attempt implementations/troubleshooting w/ schedule
7. If I fall behind schedule network for help. 

I could expalin my goal at step 3 to an AI that will help break down the process into achievable steps. This will help me stay on focused and on track. 

### VERSION 2 ###
I will ask an AI to construct the framework I need. 
I will ask the AI to construct the parts of the framework
Ad nausum until the product is complete.


This has been unimplamentable because I first need to knwo what to ask the AI to do. 
Knowing what to ask the AI requres me to know the goal. This way I will know when steps have been skipped or 
other improvements are needed. 

This could of course be solved if I ask the AI to look at the document and summarize the steps itself.

The probelm with that is the input. Some of the equations may not render correctly, which would be highly misinterpereted by the AI.
Rather, I can create a tool that will adapt the format to something the AI can understand. Hoepfully by providing the AI with examples and allowing it to update itself.
