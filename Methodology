I am thinking about just reading the abstracks, setup and results, that way I don't get caught up reading about all the observations that may be irrelevant. 
Instead of reading the observations, 
1. I'll only read the abstracts and results,
2. think of a goal that uses mutiple papers,
3. Plan my step by step process.
4. plan what qualities my overhead will need.
5. Decide what materials will be best.
6. Attempt implementations/troubleshooting w/ schedule
7. If I fall behind schedule network for help.
