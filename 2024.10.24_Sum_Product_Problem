Can A+A and AA = {ab , a,b\in A} boht be small for the same A?

Erdo' mulitpication table problem
  is a classic problem in number theory related to counting distinct 
  products in a multiplication table. 

I am confused how the values on the table change over the table because it seems to say the table is the results of two numbers x and y. But how can there be a table if x and y only can have one result?

Turns out, it seems to multiply by this table:
1 * 1 ; 1 * 2 ; 1 * 3 ;
2 * 1 ; 2 * 2 ; 2 * 3 ;
3 * 1 ; 3 * 2 ; 3 * 3 ;
And is asking "how  many unique products are there?" Answer: {1,2,3,4,6,9}

There were other theroms, but I could not follow exactly what why Geon shared this with me 
or why it is relevant.
